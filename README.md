# JavaFXBrowser
This JavaFX-based browser project offers essential browsing features such as URL navigation, zoom, and persistent local history with light/dark themes. Built as a focused desktop app to deepen understanding of JavaFX and GUI concepts, it is not a full-fledged production browser but a solid foundation for learning and further enhancement.

# JavaFXBrowser 🌐✨

![JavaFXBrowser](https://img.shields.io/badge/JavaFX-Browser-blue?style=flat-square)

JavaFXBrowser is a lightweight desktop browser built with JavaFX featuring URL navigation, zoom controls, persistent local history, and light/dark themes. Designed as a focused learning app, it provides solid JavaFX and GUI experience but is not a full production-grade browse.

## Features 🚀

- 🚦 **Fast and Responsive WebView Browser** powered by JavaFX's native WebEngine  
- 🏠 **Customizable Homepage** — start with Google and browse anywhere  
- 🔍 **URL/Search Bar** with smart protocol handling (auto "http://" prefix)  
- 🔄 **Page Refresh, Zoom In/Out** controls for browsing comfort  
- 📜 **Persistent Browsing History** saved to local disk and editable inside the app  
- 🎯 Double-click history items to instantly reload pages  
- ❌ Delete or clear individual/all history entries dynamically  
- 🌗 **Light and Dark Themes** toggle for eye-friendly viewing  
- ⚙️ **Settings Window** for theme switching and further expansion  
- 🧩 Modular and clean MVC architecture — easy to extend & maintain
